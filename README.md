# repo-me

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/phholler/repo-me/_apis/build/status/repo-me%20pipeline)](https://dev.azure.com/phholler/repo-me/_build/latest?definitionId=1)

repo-me is a GitHub App, built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot), to automate the creation and scaffolding of repositories based on configured templates.

## How it works

To create a new repo users of repo-me open up a new issue in the `create-repository` repo within their organization. The desired name for the new repository, as well as the template on which it will be based, are included in the opening post in the issue. repo-me then creates the issue and posts the link to the new repo before closing the issue.

For organizations utilizing [chatOps RPC](https://github.com/bhuga/hubot-chatops-rpc), repo-me can be used within your configured chat client.

## Setup

Setting up repo-me requires four steps:

1. Deploying the repo-me app
2. Creating and configuring of the `create-repository` repo
3. Creating template repositories
4. (optionally) configuring the chatOps RPC endpoint

### 1. Deploying the repo-me app

The probot [deployment documents](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/) detail how to deploy to various providers. 

You'll need to set an environment variable `APP_NAME` with the name of your app - you might want to call it something else. For instance `APP_NAME=sudo-me-a-repo`, in case you like to name things based on [XKCD comics](https://xkcd.com/149/).

If you will be utilizing the chatOps RPC capabilities of repo-me, be sure to set an `RPC_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable to your RPC server's public key. The probot deployment docs have a good example of this, too.

### 2. Configuring `create-repository`

`repo-me` requires used of a repository called `create-repository` in the organization in which the app is installed. This repository is used to:

* store the organization's configuration of `repo-me`
* create new repositories by opening up issues based on a configured [issue template](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates/)

an example configuration of `create-repository` can be cloned from [here](https://github.com/pholleran/create-repository)

### 3. Creating template repositories

Any repository within an organization can serve as a template. Repository contents of new repos will be duplicates of the template on which they are based, with any reference to the template name the repo replaced with the new repository name.

For a repository to be available as a template in repo-me, it must be configured. Simply add repo names (one per line) to the `template_repos:` section of the `.github\repo-me.yml` file in `create-repository`.

#### 3.5 Automating configuration of template repositories

repo-me will not configure administrative settings of any repos it creates. To automate the setup of repository settings, consider installing [probot-settings](https://github.com/apps/settings) on all repositories in your organization. If your template includes a `settings.yml` file, `probot-settings` will apply the settings upon creation of the new repository.

### 4. (optionally) configuring chatOps RPC

repo-me [exposes an express route](https://probot.github.io/docs/http/) at `https://<host>/repo-me/repo` for use with chatOps RPC. The endpoint exposes a `create` command that takes the target organization name (in which repo-me must be configured), new repo name, and template as parameters. Using [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) and [hubot-chatops-rpc](https://github.com/bhuga/hubot-chatops-rpc/projects) the command syntax becomes `hubot create <inThisOrg> <aRepoWithThisName> <usingThisTemplate>`.
